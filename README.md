# TripToTheZoo

-- project idea:
Our idea was to teach children information about some animals in the zoo, and how to distinguish between them, and learn some of their characteristics and abilities. The story begins with a child entering the zoo and choosing an animal he wants to know Information about that animal to appear and ends with the child leaving the zoo after obtaining sufficient information about the animals.
